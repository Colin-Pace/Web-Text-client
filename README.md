Documentation of API: The server is accessed through the inputs. For example, the user can access the server by entering a user name and password into the landing page so that they login. So too, the user can enter those inputs on the registration and the account pages also to reach the server, but for, respectively, creating and deleting an account. Another way to access the server by the client, is to enter a folder name, click on the folder name, click on a folder menu link, enter text into the post text areas, and click on the posts. All these interactions will send information to the server for storage and retrieval.
